# Introduction

Less automates the creation and deployment of serverless [Static Websites](/static-websites), [REST APIs](/rest-apis), [Web Sockets](/web-sockets), [Key-Value Store](/key-value-store), [Pub/Sub](/fanout), [CRON Jobs](/cron-jobs), and [Shared Code](/shared-code) based on your file structure. Just write your code and deploy using your favorite programming language. 

---

Less inspects your `/less` directory and **provisions your serverless AWS resources for you**.

```
â”€ less
  â””â”€ statics
  â””â”€ apis
  â””â”€ sockets
  â””â”€ topics
  â””â”€ external_topics
  â””â”€ crons
  â””â”€ shared
  â””â”€ functions
```

:::tip
You can even drop a `/less` folder in an existing project and deploy. You'll barely notice Less is there!
:::

In this documentation you'll find everything you need to create and deploy each of these Less resources.

## Supported Languages
Less fully supports Node.js and Python. You can even use both in the same project!
