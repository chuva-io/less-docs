[Less](https://less.chuva.io) was built to allow a very small number of Senior Engineers and Architects to leverage large teams of Junior Engineers to quickly and reliably iterate and deliver advanced software systems.

## Chuva, the team behind Less.

[Chuva](https://chuva.io) is a small software development company based in Mindelo, Cabo Verde. We work both as an agency, supporting companies around the world on their software and cloud endeavors, as well as building our own products, services, and open source tools. We have a strong focus on engineering (not development), architecture, and modularity (single responsibility principle) and enjoy working in cross-functional and service-based teams.

As far as innovation in Cabo Verde goes, our ecosystem is just getting started. We're taking some important steps as a country but we still lack the resources, skills, incentives, and policies to truly see sustainable innovation. This unique set of challenges, our skills and experience, and the drive and audacity to dream big and overcome them led our team to naturally create Less.

## How Does Less Help?

> No more DevOps. No more infrastructure. No more Cloud.

What do most projects/systems have in common that add nothing unique to your business? Where is time and money being completely wasted on repetition, human error, quality control, and expensive resources?

Less creates your Cloud resources for you, including Static Websites, REST APIs, Web Sockets, Key-Value Store, Topics/Subscribers (Pub/Sub), CRON Jobs, Cloud Functions, and File Storage based on your file structure. Just write your code and deploy to AWS using Node.js and Python. You won't even notice Less is there.

A simple "Hello world" in Terraform is [over 150 lines of code](/blog/2024/04/05/creating-rest-apis-less-vs-terraform#implementation-using-terraform). [With Less it's less than 5](/blog/2024/04/05/creating-rest-apis-less-vs-terraform#create-the-route) and there's no learning curve. Some simple demo projects we've worked on in attempts to think outside the box with Less include building a [real-time React app with server-side Redux state streams](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7090793413700132866), [streaming sensor data from Arduinos to Slack channels](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7090815379882561536), and _running matrix operations in Javascript using Numpy_. We even use Less to develop several Less features!

**No time to waste. No room for mistakes.**

We've been eating our own dog food for over a year now and currently have over 100 internal services and environments deployed using Less. It has given us a remarkable increase in development speed and has made "serverless fault-tolerant event-driven microservices" sound like a gimmick (as true as it is) and has just become "writing software" again.

## No Idea is Original

As we were preparing to make our first announcements about Less, and after extensive research, we were able to catch wind of the amazing [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com) spinoff, [Ampt](https://getampt.com) and its CEO [Jeramy Daly](https://twitter.com/jeremy_daly). Jeramy's community contributions led us down the Infrastructure from Code rabbit hole and we discovered more amazing and similar projects including [Wing](https://www.wing.cloud), [Encore](https://encore.dev), and [Nitric](https://nitric.io). We are pleased to see their hard work and successes, with Wing and Encore going so far as to receive $20M and $3M in funding respectively! Best of luck to all of you!

Although these discoveries ruined the illusion that we had an original idea - how sad ðŸ˜¢ - they also validated in an extraordinary way that we have something truly unique on our hands that will become a new standard!

We are working on adding support for Rust and Go as well as more Cloud providers and we will be announcing our pricing structure and roadmap soon. We are also looking for strategic partnerships & investors so please reach out if you appreciate our work and want to become a part of it.

We're extremely excited and privileged to be working on a project with such potential. We'll keep pushing to make [Less](https://less.chuva.io) the best in the industry. We hope you're rooting for us!

No bai! ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡»
