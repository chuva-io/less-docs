# Introduction

Less automates the creation and deployment of serverless [Static Websites](/static-websites), [REST APIs](/rest-apis), [Web Sockets](/web-sockets), [Key-Value Store](/key-value-store), [Pub/Sub](/fanout), [CRON Jobs](/cron-jobs), and [Shared Code](/shared-code) based on your file structure. Just write your code and deploy using your favorite programming language. 

---

Less inspects your `/less` directory and **provisions your serverless AWS resources for you**.

```
─ less
  └─ statics
  └─ apis
  └─ sockets
  └─ topics
  └─ external_topics
  └─ crons
  └─ shared
  └─ functions
```

:::tip
You can even drop a `/less` folder in an existing project and deploy. You'll barely notice Less is there!
:::

In this documentation you'll find everything you need to create and deploy each of these Less resources.

## Supported Languages
Less fully supports Node.js and Python. You can even use both in the same project!

The high level of simplicity with Less will make you feel like something is missing... 😜
