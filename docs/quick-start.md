# Quick Start

**Deploy a Serverless Node.js REST API to AWS in 3 Minutes Using Less.**

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through creating and deploying a "Hello, world" REST API, demonstrating the ease of use of Less. With automatic cloud resource provisioning, infinite auto-scaling, security best practices, fault-tolerance, and more by default, it's never been easier to get code to production!

## Create your Less project

```bash
mkdir less-quick-start
cd less-quick-start
```

## Install the Less CLI

<Tabs groupId="package-manager" queryString="package-manager">

  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm i -g @chuva.io/less-cli
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn global add @chuva.io/less-cli
    ```
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Create your REST API route
Run the following command to create a `GET /hello` route in Javascript.
```bash
less-cli create route --name demo --language js --verb get --path /hello
```

This will create the following route.
```js title="less/apis/demo/hello/get.js"
exports.process = async (request, response) => {
  response.body = 'Hello, world.';
  return response;
};
```

You can run the following command to learn more about the options provided above.
```bash
less-cli create route --help
```

## Test your project locally
Less allows you to preview your project locally before deploying to AWS. Let's see how to build and run your project.

### Build
Less allows you to create a named build locally which makes it possible to run multiple versions of the same project. This allows you to run the same project with different environment variables or code versions.
```bash
less-cli build getting-started
```

### Run
Once you have built your project you can run it with the following command.
```bash
less-cli run getting-started
```

Running your project produces the following output.
```bash
[less-local] App "getting-started" is running âœ…
[less-local] Resources:
[less-local]   List of APIs:
[less-local]     - demo: http://localhost:3333
[less-local] ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡»
```

### Test
Now that we have our project running locally let's test it. Run the following command to test it using CURL in your terminal.
```bash
curl localhost:3333/hello
```

## Deploy to production
You can deploy your project to production with a single command.
```bash
less-cli deploy getting-started
```

ðŸš€ Congratulations! You have deployed your Serverless REST API to AWS!

ðŸ¤© Does it get any easier than that?!

:::note You will need to be logged in to your Less account in order to deploy.
If you don't have a Less account you can create one and log in using the following commands.
```bash
less-cli register
less-cli login
```
