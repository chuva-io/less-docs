  <summary>ü´•¬†Some tasks you just don't want or need to do yourself.</summary>
  
  In most cases, your Cloud Infrastructure is a time-consuming, complex, error-prone task that brings no differentiation to your business. What if you didn't need to deal with it?
</details>


<details>
  <summary>ü§ñ¬†Now, you can do less of them because Less takes care of them for you.</summary>
  
  Less takes an extraordinary cost and burden off of your hands by automating the provisioning, configuration, and scaling of your cloud infrastructure. In many cases you can completely forget the cloud exists!
</details>


<details>
  <summary>üßê¬†There are still some tasks that require your attention.</summary>
  
  While Less automates much of the cloud infrastructure setup for you, there are still some cases where you need more control‚Äîsuch as custom network configurations, fine-tuning resource properties, or connecting cloud services in ways unique to your use-cases.
</details>


<details>
  <summary>üöÄ¬†Less can make those easier too.</summary>
  
  Less gives you absolute control over your cloud resources when you need it, allowing DevOps teams to customize the Less infrastructure, connect it to existing systems, or free up their time to work on other projects.

## What is Less?

Less is an Infrastructure from Code tool that automates the creation and deployment of serverless [Static Websites](/static-websites), [REST APIs](/rest-apis), [Web Sockets](/web-sockets), [Key-Value Stores](/key-value-store), [Topics and Subscribers (Pub Sub)](/topics_subscribers), [CRON Jobs](/cron-jobs), [Cloud Functions](/cloud-functions), [File Storage](/file-storage), and more based on your file structure.


### Language Support
Just write your code and deploy using your favorite programming language. Even use more than one language in the same project. You won't even notice Less is there!

<Tabs groupId="programming-language" queryString="programming-language">
  
  <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Node.js">
  **Create a `GET /hello` route.**
  ```js title="less/apis/demo/hello/get.js" showLineNumbers
  exports.process = async (request, response) => {
    response.body = 'Hello, world.';
    response.status_code = 200;
    return response;
  };
  ```

  **Subscribe to a `user_created` event and send a welcome email.**
  ```js title="less/topics/user_created/send_welcome_email/index.js" showLineNumbers
    exports.process = async (user) => {
      console.log(`Sending a welcome email to ${user.email}`);
    };
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="py" label="Python">
  **Create a `GET /hello` route.**
  ```py title="less/apis/demo/hello/get.py" showLineNumbers
  def process(request, response):
    response['body'] = 'Hello, world.'
    response['statusCode'] = 200
    return response
  ```

  **Subscribe to a `user_created` event and send a welcome email.**
  ```py title="less/topics/user_created/send_welcome_email/__init__.py" showLineNumbers
    def process(user):
      print(f"Sending a welcome email to {user['email']}")
    ```
  </TabItem>
  
  </Tabs>

:::tip You can deploy the examples above with the Less CLI

```bash
less-cli deploy my-first-project-production
```

### Cloud Providers
Less can deploy your code to your Less-managed, sandboxed cloud account or you can connect Less to your existing cloud provider.

### Extend Less with IaC
Take full control by connecting Less to your Infrastructure as Code tools. Extend or customize your Less infrastructure as you see fit. There are no limits.

## Blessings of Using Less

_**Automate your meaningless cloud infrastructure.**_  
Less inspects your file structure and properly provisions and deploys your code and cloud infrastructure for you without you ever having to deal with cloud providers, containers, or DevOps.

_**Get started effortlessly.**_  
Less uses essentially the same code you are already accustomed to. If you can write code, you already know how to build and deploy infinitely scalable, serverless, distributed, fault-tolerant systems to the cloud. Just add your code to a `/less` folder to get started.

_**Limitless possibilities.**_
Take full control by connecting Less to your IaC tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, and Pulumi directly in your cloud account. There are no limits!

:::tip With Less you can write 97% less code than with Terraform

_**Enhance your Existing Projects with Less.**_  
Create a new project using Less or add one feature at a time to an existing project. 

_**Built in Key-Value Store and File Storage.**_  
Automatic provisioning of a low latency key-value store and cloud file storage with each deployment.

_**Fearlessly Create Event-Driven Microservices.**_  
Less gives you fault tolerant topics and processors (pub/sub) with guaranteed message delivery and processing. Connect your services by subscribing to topics from different deployments. It doesn‚Äôt get easier than this.
