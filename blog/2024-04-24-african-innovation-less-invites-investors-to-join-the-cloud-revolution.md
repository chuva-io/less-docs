[Less](/) offers investors an opportunity to participate in a pioneering technology with significant growth potential.

<!-- truncate -->

Our team at Chuva is proud to invite investors to participate in our growth and development for the first time in our history! As a bootstrapped company and project, we have achieved remarkable milestones with limited resources, showcasing our ability to innovate and execute effectively.

Over the past 2 years our competitors have able to secure between $3M - $20M in investments by some big names in the industry. Based in Cabo Verde, Africa, we have been able to create a remarkable offering in half the time and at a fraction of the cost while also providing innovative features that are well positioned to out-pace our competition.

Already in our growth stage, we are seeking a $750K investment at a $7.5M valuation to support our growth and innovation efforts over the next three years. This investment will be strategically allocated to product development and marketing.

## Cloud Development Challenges
Traditional software development involves complex cloud infrastructure management and specialists, high costs, and long development cycles. Developers often struggle with cloud configuration, DevOps tasks, and integration challenges, slowing down innovation.

## How does Less Solve these Challenges?
Less simplifies and accelerates software development by automating best practices, minimizing the learning curve, and delivering high quality, performance, scale, and cost-efficiency. It eliminates the complexity of managing cloud infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on core business logic and innovation.

## What is Less?
Less is a framework that automates cloud infrastructure provisioning and deployment, enabling developers to build anything from the simplest to the most complex software systems in a fast, accessible, reliable, and scalable way, radically reducing software development costs, complexity, and time to develop and deploy. With built-in and managed security features Less also offers significant advantages for industries where compliance and security are paramount.

## Market Opportunity
The market opportunity for cloud computing and serverless technologies is vast and rapidly expanding, presenting significant growth potential for innovative solutions like Less.

### Cloud Computing Market
The global cloud computing market is projected to reach $832.1 billion by 2025, driven by increasing digital transformation initiatives across industries.

### Demand for Developer Tools
There is a rising demand for developer tools that streamline cloud infrastructure management and facilitate agile software development practices. As organizations seek to accelerate their digital transformation journeys, the need for efficient tools like Less and other [Infrastructure from Code (IfC)](https://infrastructurefromcode.com) tools to automate infrastructure provisioning and deployment is becoming increasingly evident. This growing demand presents ample opportunities for innovative solutions that simplify and enhance the software development process.

The convergence of these market dynamics underscores the immense opportunity for Less to capitalize on the growing demand for cloud-native, serverless solutions that enable developers to focus on building innovative applications without the complexity of managing infrastructure.

## Differentiation
Less stands out from competitors with its unique approach to Infrastructure from Code (IfC), emphasis on serverless architecture and automation, and flexibility to use multiple languages and frameworks. Its seamless integration of cloud infrastructure provisioning and deployment sets it apart in the market. 

Our location in Cabo Verde, Africa, also provides us with a distinct advantage in terms of cost efficiency. This advantage translates to lower investment requirements and more competitive pricing for our customers, without compromising on quality or features.

Some of our competitors include:
- AWS (Amazon) Amplify: Released in 2017.
- Encore: Raised $3M in funding in 2022.
- Wing: Raised $20M in 2022.

### Feature Comparison
Less offers essentially all the features available in our competitors' offerings while also providing several unique features and benefits that our competitors do not offer, enhancing the value proposition for our customers.

### Speed of Development
Less was built in less than half the time as our competitors' platforms, demonstrating our ability to deliver efficient and effective solutions with limited resources.

### Cost Competitiveness
Less operation costs are at least an order of magnitude less than our competitors, enabling us to maintain a lean and efficient operation while delivering value to our customers.

### Ease of Use
With almost no learning curve, Less is designed to be much easier and intuitive to use than our competitors' platforms, simplifying the development and deployment process for developers of all skill levels.
